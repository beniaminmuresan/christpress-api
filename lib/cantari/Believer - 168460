[V1.1]
 I dream of tongues of fire
 Resting on Your people,  

[V1.2]
 I dream of all  the miracles to come.
 I hope to see the coming  

[V1.3]
 Healing of the nations,
 I long to see the prodigals return.  

[V1.4]
 So many hopes and longings in you
 When will all the dreams come true?  

[C1.1]
 I'm a believer in your kindom,
 I am a seeker of the new things,  

[C1.2]
 I am a dreamer of some old dreams,
 Let them now come!  

[C1.3]
 (Will you now come?)  

[V2.1]
 I hope to see you come down,
 Rend the mighty heavens,  

[V2.2]
 And let Your glory cover all the earth;
 to see Your sons and daughters  

[V2.3]
 Come to know and love You,
 And find a purer passion in the church.  

[V2.4]
 These are the things my heart will pursue;
 When will all the dreams come true?  

[V3.1]
 May Your church now reach out,
 Sowing truth and justice,  

[V3.2]
 Learning to love the poor and help the weak.
 When your kindom's coming  

[V3.3]
 It will touch the broken,
 Place the lonley ina family.  

[V3.4]
 So many hopes and longings in You;
 When will all the dreams come true?
