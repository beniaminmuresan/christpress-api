[V1.1]
 Will you come and be free from the bondage of sin?
 Jesus has died on the tree;  

[V1.2]
 He has purchased redemption to gather you in;
 Mercy is calling for thee.  

[C1.1]
 Oh, will you come? Oh, will you come?
 Jesus will save every one;  

[C1.2]
 Oh, beware! Don’t you see there is pardon for thee?
 Mercy is calling you home.  

[V2.1]
 Will you come to Him now? Then resist every wrong;
 Happy indeed you will be;  

[V2.2]
 He will bless you with peace and with heavenly song;
 Mercy is calling for thee.  

[V3.1]
 Will you come as you are? for He knoweth your heart,
 Jesus will make trouble flee;  

[V3.2]
 He will banish your gloom, He will vict’ry impart;
 Mercy is calling for thee.  

[V4.1]
 Will you come? He will save;
 How He pleads with you now!—  

[V4.2]
 Jesus had mercy on me—
 He’s the best friend you have, oh, be humble and bow!  

[V4.3]
 Mercy is calling for thee.
