[V1.1]
 Let not your weary heart be troubled,
 Believe in God, believe in Me;  

[V1.2]
 For in My Father’s house are mansions,
 I will prepare a place for thee.  

[C1.1]
 Let not your heart be troubled,
 Let not your heart be troubled;  

[C1.2]
 Let not your heart be troubled,
 Nor let it be afraid.  

[V2.1]
 Let not your peace in calm assurance
 Be ruffled by the storms of life;  

[V2.2]
 But soldier-like, with firm endurance,
 Just glory in the holy strife.  

[V3.1]
 Let not your hope be dimmed with doubting,
 Let not life’s burdens foil your grace;  

[V3.2]
 But in each conflict vict’ry shouting,
 Like he who runs to win a race.
