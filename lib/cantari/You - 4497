[V1.1]
 There's always something
 In the way  

[V1.2]
 There's always something
 Getting through  

[V1.3]
 But it's not me
 It's You, it's You  

[C1.1]
 Sometimes ignorance
 Rings true  

[C1.2]
 But hope is not in
 What i know  

[C1.3]
 It's not in me..me
 It's in You, it's in You  

[B1.1]
 It's all i know
 It's all i know  

[B1.2]
 It's all i know  

[V2.1]
 I find peace when
 I'm confused  

[V2.2]
 I find hope when
 I'm let down  

[V2.3]
 Not in me ... Me
 In You  

[V2.4]
 It's in you  

[V3.1]
 I hope to lose myself
 For good  

[V3.2]
 I hope to find it in the end
 Not in me ... Me  

[V3.3]
 In You
 In You  

[V3.4]
 In You  

[B1.1]
 It's all i know
 It's all i know  

[B1.2]
 It's all i know
 In You  

[B1.3]
 In You
 Its in You  

[B1.4]
 Its in You  

[T1.1]
 There's always something in the way
 There's always something getting through  

[T1.2]
 But it's not me
 It's You  

[T1.3]
 It's You
 It's You ....
