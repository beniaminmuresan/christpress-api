[V1.1]
 Who is knocking at your heart today?
 Let the Savior in;  

[V1.2]
 Sinner, do not grieve the Lord away,
 Will you let Him in?  

[C]
 Let Him in, let Him in,
 Sinner, rise, let Him in.  

[V2.1]
 He is ling’ring at the closed door,
 Let the Savior in;  

[V2.2]
 You have heard Him knocking o’er and o’er,
 Will you let Him in?  

[V3.1]
 He has long protected you from death,
 Let the Savior in;  

[V3.2]
 Don’t refuse the Lord who gives you breath,
 Will you let Him in?  

[V4.1]
 On the cross His blood was shed so free,
 Let the Savior in;  

[V4.2]
 Do not let your will thus dormant be,
 Will you let Him in?  

[V5.1]
 Is your heart now like the granite stone?
 Let the Savior in;  

[V5.2]
 Soon His blood for you will not atone,
 Will you let Him in?
