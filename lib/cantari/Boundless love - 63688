[V1.1]
 There is not a mother, sister, friend, or brother
 Loves the way that Jesus can.  

[V1.2]
 He proved His love for me
 When He died on Calvary  

[V1.3]
 He gave His life for fallen man  

[C1.1]
 His love (His love) is a boundless love
 And it reaches down and touches me (touches me).  

[C1.2]
 His love (His love) is an endless love
 That will last through all eternity  

[V2.1]
 Jesus wants to love you
 There is none above you  

[V2.2]
 You are precious in His sight
 He will never fail you  

[V2.3]
 When the doubts assail you
 He'll be with you day and night  

[C2.1]
 His love (His love); His love (His love)
 His love (His love); His love (His love)  

[C2.2]
 His love is an endless love (His boundless... love)
