[V1.1]
 I know I am not worthy
 To come to you my King,  

[V1.2]
 I know I am not worthy
 To come before you and sing,  

[V1.3]
 But You in all Your mercy
 Forgive me, all my sins,  

[V1.4]
 I want to thank You Jesus,
 You are my everything.  

[C1.1]
 You are Jesus the king who died for me,
 You are Jesus the One who set me free,  

[C1.2]
 I want to serve You Jesus,
 I need your help for that,  

[C1.3]
 Please help me to be thankful
 For now and evermore  

[V2.1]
 I know I am not worthy
 To come to you my King,  

[V2.2]
 I know I am not worthy
 To come before you and sing,  

[V2.3]
 But You in all Your mercy
 Forgive me, all my sins,  

[V2.4]
 I want to thank You Jesus,
 You are my everything.
