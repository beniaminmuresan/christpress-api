[V1.1]
 Pain and grief and poverty still in
 Bitterness and anxiety, the sin  

[V1.2]
 Draw me down in the mud again;
 Darkness and the lonelieness brake in  

[V1.3]
 In my heart now I'm a part from Him
 I am crawling and I fell the shame;  

[V1.4]
 But I find His hand again.  

[C]
 Carry me through,Jesus.  

[V2.1]
 I can fell the heavy chain on me
 I am cold and shuddering: Oh Je'  

[V2.2]
 I am crying: Jesus save, save me!
 Then a love I never felt before  

[V2.3]
 Lifts me up and give me strenght and more
 Then I hear: I'll never let you go!  

[V2.4]
 I thank you my sweet Jesus for making me
 hole!
