[V1.1]
 Precious Lord, take my hand,
 Lead me on, let me stand,  

[V1.2]
 I am tired, I am weak, I am worn;
 Through the storm, through the night,  

[V1.3]
 Lead me on to the light:  

[C]
 Take my hand, precious Lord,
 Lead me home.  

[V2.1]
 When my way grows drear,
 Precious Lord, linger near,  

[V2.2]
 When my life is almost gone,
 Hear my cry, hear my call,  

[V2.3]
 Hold my hand lest I fall:  

[V3.1]
 When the darkness appears
 And the night draws near,  

[V3.2]
 And the day is past and gone,
 At the river I stand,  

[V3.3]
 Guide my feet, hold my hand:
