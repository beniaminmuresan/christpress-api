[V1.1]
 Oh, home of my soul
 In that far away goal,  

[V1.2]
 Each day brings me nearer to thee;
 The great throne so white,  

[V1.3]
 And my crown shining bright,
 Mine eyes ever longing to see.  

[V2.1]
 A musical strain
 From that far distant plain  

[V2.2]
 Now sweeps gently over my soul;
 And waves of sweet peace  

[V2.3]
 In my heart shall increase,
 While years of eternity roll.  

[V3.1]
 The day will soon come
 When weâ€™ll all gather home,  

[V3.2]
 As pilgrims no more we shall roam;
 Ah, whom shall we see?  

[V3.3]
 And what joy will it be
 To meet with the dear ones at home!
