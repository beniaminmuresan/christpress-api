[V1.1]
 Our father in heaven, Your name lives forever
 Your kingdom shall come down and Your will be done  

[V1.2]
 You are our provider, You know what we need and
 Forgive us our failures as we will forgive  

[C1.1]
 We pray for open heavens
 Come fill this place with Your presence  

[C1.2]
 We pray for open heavens
 We‘re ready for You, we‘re ready for You  

[V2.1]
 Keep out all temptation and free us from evil
 You are the redeemer, our saviour in need  

[V2.2]
 For Yours is the kingdom and Yours is the power
 Yours is the glory, this we believe  

[B]
 We believe, we believe
 We believe, in the love of our father
