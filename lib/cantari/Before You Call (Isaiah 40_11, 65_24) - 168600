[V1.1]
 Come to me my people, come
 There's no need to be afraid of your Father  

[V1.2]
 When I see you I will run
 I will be there, I will be there  

[C1.1]
 Before you call, I will answer you
 While you still speak, I will hear  

[C1.2]
 My ears are turned to the cry of my chosen ones
 In my love you can rest in me  

[C1.3]
 For you are my very own
 So hold on to the hope you have  

[C1.4]
 That I would draw you to myself
 For I will never leave you alone  

[T]
 I will not forget you, I gather my lambs in my arms
 So I will comfort you and carry you close to my heart!
