[V1.1]
 What did you do, to have His precious Love?
 A love from heaven, comes to you as gift.  

[V1.2]
 What did you do to have nice wings like dove?
 To fly towards heaven, in one night releafe.  

[C1.1]
 I did nothing, you did nothing,
 But God gave us His only beloved Son.  

[C1.2]
 He died for you,He died for me,
 Just be prepared, The Lord is coming soon.  

[V2.1]
 What did you do to have His guard with you?
 Heâ€™s watching every step of yours  

[V2.2]
 What did you do, to have His love with you?
 And with His love, you can climb over mountains.  

[V3.1]
 What did you do to have a place in heaven?
 To Know that, you and me, will be together,  

[V3.2]
 What did you do to meet one day with Simon?
 We just have faith: But Jesus is who gather.
