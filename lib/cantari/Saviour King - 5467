[V1.1]
 And now the weak say I have strength
 By the spirit of power that raised Christ from the dead  

[V1.2]
 And now the poor stand and confess
 That my portion is ? and I'm more blessed  

[B1.1]
 Let now our hearts burn with a flame
 A fire consuming all for your Son's holy name  

[B1.2]
 And with the heavens we declare
 You are our king  

[C1.1]
 We love you Lord, we worship you
 You are our God, you alone are good  

[C1.2]
 You asked your Son to carry this
 The heavy cross our weight of sin  

[C1.3]
 I love you Lord, I worship you
 Hope which was lost, now stands renewed  

[C1.4]
 I give my life to honor this
 The love of Christ, the savior king  

[V2.1]
 Let now your church shine as the bride
 That you soar in your heart as you offered up your life  

[V2.2]
 Let now the lost be welcomed home
 By the saved and redeemed those adopted as your own  

[T]
 I give my life to honor this
 The love of Christ, the savior king
