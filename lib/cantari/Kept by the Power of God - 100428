[V1.1]
 We are kept by the power and favor of God
 From all the dominion of sin;  

[V1.2]
 He cleanseth by faith in His own precious blood,
 His spirit is reigning within.  

[C1.1]
 We are kept by the power of God,
 We are kept by the power of God;  

[C1.2]
 By trusting, obeying,
 By watching and praying,  

[C1.3]
 We are kept by the power of God.  

[V2.1]
 We are kept by the power of God through faith
 So long as we walk in the light;  

[V2.2]
 Our helper is Jesus who faithfully saith,
 “I’m with you by day and by night.”  

[V3.1]
 We are kept by the power of God if we trust,
 We never need faint by the way;  

[V3.2]
 Then do as He bids you, His counsel is just,
 Be humble, be watchful, and pray.  

[V4.1]
 We are kept by the power of God each day,
 The story of grace we’ll repeat;  

[V4.2]
 Through Him we are conquerors if we obey,
 The foe we will ever defeat.
