[V1.1]
 In the morning I hear You calling
 ‘Talk with Me and be still.  

[V1.2]
 Take My peace, take My love,
 Calm your soul and be free’  

[B1.1]
 You gave me hope
 You took my sorrow  

[B1.2]
 You loved me as I am
 That’s why I can sing  

[B1.3]
 Of Your great love  

[C1.1]
 Lord I lift Your name on high
 Every ocean will run dry  

[C1.2]
 With Your love
 Every second of my life  

[C1.3]
 You are keeping me alive
 With Your love  

[V2.1]
 ‘I lift my eyes to the mountains
 Where does my help comes from?  

[V2.2]
 My help comes from the Lord
 The Maker of Heaven and Earth’ (Psalms 121:1-2)  

[B1.1]
 Through Your mercy now I see
 ‘I walk by faith, not by sight’ (2 Corinthians 5:7)  

[B1.2]
 ‘The Lord will fight for me
 I only need to be still.’ (Exodus 14:14)  

[C1.1]
 Lord I lift Your name on high
 Every ocean will run dry  

[C1.2]
 With Your love
 Every second of my life  

[C1.3]
 You are keeping me alive
 With Your love  

[T]
 ‘If God is all I have
 I have all I need’ (John 1.14:8)  

[T1.2]
 ‘I will fear no evil’ (Psalms 23:4)
 ‘I’ll just believe’ (Mark 5:36)
