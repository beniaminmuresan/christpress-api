[V1.1]
 I have made You too small in my eyes
 O Lord,  forgive me;  

[V1.2]
 And   I have believed in a lie
 That You were unable to help me.  

[V1.3]
 But now, O Lord, I see my wrong
 Heal my heart and show Yourself strong;  

[V1.4]
 And in my eyes and with my song
 O Lord, be magnified!  

[C1.1]
 Be magnified, O Lord
 You are highly exalted;  

[C1.2]
 And there is nothing You can't do
 O Lord, my eyes are on You.  

[C1.3]
 Be magnified,
 O Lord, be magnified.  

[V2.1]
 I have leaned on the wisdom of men
 O Lord, forgive me;  

[V2.2]
 And I have responded to them
 Instead of Your light and Your mercy.  

[V2.3]
 But now, O Lord, I see my wrong
 Heal my heart and show Yourself strong;  

[V2.4]
 And in my eyes with my song
 O Lord, be magnified!
