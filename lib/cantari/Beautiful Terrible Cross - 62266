[V1.1]
 There is a beautiful terrible cross
 Where though You committed no sin  

[V1.2]
 Savior You suffered the most wicked fate
 On the cruelest creation of men.  

[C1.1]
 Yet on that beautiful terrible cross
 You did what only You could  

[C1.2]
 Turning that dark inspired evil of hell
 Into our soul's greatest good.  

[V2.1]
 We see the love that You showed us
 We see the live that You lost  

[V2.2]
 We bow in wonder and praise You
 For the beautiful terrible cross.  

[V3.1]
 There on that beautiful terrible cross
 Though darkness was strong on that hill  

[V3.2]
 You remained sovereign, Lord, still in control
 As Your perfect plan was fulfilled.  

[V4.1]
 We gained the riches of heaven
 Jesus You paid the horrible cost  

[V4.2]
 We stand forgiven and praise You
 For the beautiful terrible cross.  

[T1.1]
 In the cross, in the cross
 Be my glory ever  

[T1.2]
 Till my raptured soul shall find
 Rest beyond the river.
