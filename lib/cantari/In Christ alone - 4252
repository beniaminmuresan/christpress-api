[V1.1]
 In Christ alone will I glory
 Though I could pride myself in battles won  

[V1.2]
 For I've been blessed beyond measure
 And by His strength alone I overcome  

[V1.3]
 Oh I could stop and count successes
 Like diamonds in my hand  

[V1.4]
 But those trophies could not equal
 To the grace by which I stand.  

[C1.1]
 In Christ alone I place my trust
 And find my glory in the power of the cross  

[C1.2]
 In every victory let it be said of me
 My source of strength, my source of hope is Christ alone.  

[V2.1]
 In Christ alone will I glory
 For only by His grace I am redeemed  

[V2.2]
 And only His tender mercy
 Could reach beyond my weakness to my need  

[V2.3]
 Now I seek no greater honor
 Than just to know Him more  

[V2.4]
 And to count my gains
 But losses to the glory of my Lord.
