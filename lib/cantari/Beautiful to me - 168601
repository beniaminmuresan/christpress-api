[V1.1]
 You're beautiful, so beautiful
 Lord You are my bright and morning star.

 oh shining light I lift your name up high

 Lord you're beautiful to me,
 And your kingdom is all I wanna see.  

[V2.2]
 Lord you're beautiful to me
 And your kingdom is all I wanna see.

 You're powerful, so powerful
 risen Lord, exalted evermore.

 You're powerful, so powerful,
 exalted King, I lift my voice and sing.  

[V4.1]
 Lord you're powerful to me
 and your kingdom is all I wanna see.

 You're glorious, so glorious
 Holy One, the only perfect son.

 Lord you're glorious to me,
 and your praises are all I wanna sing.  

[V6.2]
 Lord You're glorious to me
 and your praises are all I wanna sing.
