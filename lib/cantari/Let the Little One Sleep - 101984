[V1.1]
 That little form before us
 In death’s embrace,  

[V1.2]
 Sweet angel face,
 Has left a vacant place.  

[C1.1]
 Let the little one sleep,
 Let the little one sleep,  

[C1.2]
 It is free from this world of care;
 The Master has come,  

[C1.3]
 And called it home,
 It is resting over there.  

[V2.1]
 Our darling child is sleeping,
 It’s left this shore,  

[V2.2]
 Forevermore,
 Its suff’ring days are o’er.  

[V3.1]
 Our little one is living
 Among the blest  

[V3.2]
 In sweeter rest;
 Our Father knoweth best.  

[V4.1]
 Our child has gone to glory;
 Let us prepare  

[V4.2]
 To meet it there,
 Eternal bliss to share.
