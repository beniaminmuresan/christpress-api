[V1.1]
 When the sun of your life has gone down,
 And the clouds in the west turn to gold,  

[V1.2]
 Endless death will to you then have come,
 If the light has gone out in your soul.  

[C1.1]
 Oh, just think how in death you would feel,
 With the light growing dim in your soul;  

[C1.2]
 Oh, how lonely ’twill be, oh, how still!
 If the light has gone out in your soul.  

[V2.1]
 When you come to the end of the way,
 And life’s story for you has been told,  

[V2.2]
 Oh, how sad all to you will appear
 If the light has gone out in your soul.  

[V3.1]
 When the chill winds of death ’round you steal,
 And the sweat on your brow’s damp and cold,  

[V3.2]
 What a dread in your life you would feel,
 If the light has gone out in your soul.  

[V4.1]
 When before judgment’s bar you shall stand,
 And the deeds of your life have been told,  

[V4.2]
 Good and evil appears, oh, what then,
 If the light has gone out in your soul?
