[V1.1]
 Let your light so shine that the world may see
 How to come to Christ who will set them free;  

[V1.2]
 Let its rays gleam bright when the darkness falls,
 Till each sinful soul for the Savior calls.  

[C1.1]
 Let your light shine, let your light shine,
 Let your light so shine before men;  

[C1.2]
 That they your works beholding,
 That they your works beholding,  

[C1.3]
 May glorify the Father’s name in heav’n.  

[V2.1]
 Let your light so shine everywhere you go,
 Till the tribes of earth Jesus Christ may know;  

[V2.2]
 Let its rays transpose into perfect day,
 When the clouds of gloom shall be swept away.  

[V3.1]
 Let your light so shine that its beams may reach
 Every darkened soul, thus the gospel preach;  

[V3.2]
 Let it brighter shine till that endless day,
 Bursts upon our sight ne’er to pass away.  

[V4.1]
 Let your light so shine every day and hour,
 That the truth be clothed with divinest pow’r;  

[V4.2]
 Let it brightly shine and promote God’s cause,
 To exalt His name and His holy law.
