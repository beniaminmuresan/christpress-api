[V1.1]
 Mighty to save, and mighty to keep,
 Grace like the ocean, boundless and deep;  

[V1.2]
 Will you believe it? will you receive it?
 Life everlasting reap?  

[C1.1]
 Glory to God! I know I’m saved,
 This is a blessing I have craved;  

[C1.2]
 Now I am happy, joyful in glory,
 Reigning o’er the world by sin depraved.  

[V2.1]
 Mighty to save by power divine,
 Mighty to keep in this evil time;  

[V2.2]
 Watching and praying, trusting, obeying,
 Thus life is all sublime.  

[V3.1]
 Mighty to save from sin here below,
 Mighty to conquer Satan we know;  

[V3.2]
 In every trial, or self-denial,
 Christ reigns o’er every foe.  

[V4.1]
 Mighty to keep in life’s darkest hour,
 Mighty to shield us from Satan’s pow’r;  

[V4.2]
 Then do not falter, stay on the altar,
 Christ is our strong, high tow’r.
