[V1.1]
 Even As the World began
 the stars they sang and all the angels  

[V1.2]
 Shouted for joy, shouted for joy
 And looking back through history  

[V1.3]
 Your people they have always had
 A song they must sing  

[V1.4]
 A song they must sing  

[C1.1]
 All over the world Your song will resound
 All over the world Your praises ring out  

[C1.2]
 We're living to see You're name and renown
 All over the world  

[V2.1]
 Young and old, near and far
 There's a place for ev'ry heart to  

[V2.2]
 Join in your song, join in your song
 And every nation tribe and tongue  

[V2.3]
 Come together join as one
 Give glory to God, glory to God  

[V3.1]
 Great is Your name
 And great will be your song (repeat)  

[V3.2]
 We lift up our hands and pray
 We lift up our hands and pray  

[V3.3]
 For holy is Your name  

[T]
 Your name, Your renown, are the desire of our souls
 Your fame, Your glory, Your song,
