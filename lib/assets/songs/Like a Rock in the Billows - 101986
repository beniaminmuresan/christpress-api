[V1.1]
 Like a rock in the billows I would stable be,
 Till the storm is overpast;  

[V1.2]
 Then I long to harbor, Lord, with Thee,
 In my heav’nly home at last.  

[C1.1]
 If I trust in Jesus, and obey His word,
 If I lean upon His breast;  

[C1.2]
 If I keep low down at His feet, I know
 He will give me peace and rest.  

[V2.1]
 Like a rock in the billows I would never yield
 To the angry tossing wave;  

[V2.2]
 I would cling to Christ, my sun and shield,
 For His pow’r alone can save.  

[V3.1]
 Like a rock in the billows of a boiling sea,
 When its waters leap and foam,  

[V3.2]
 I would rest secure, my Lord, in Thee,
 Till the trumpet calls me home.  

[V4.1]
 Like a rock in the billows I would fearless stand,
 And defy the threat’ning blast;  

[V4.2]
 For the Savior holds me by the hand,
 Till the raging storm is past.
