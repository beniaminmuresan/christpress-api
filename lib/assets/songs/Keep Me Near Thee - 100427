[V1.1]
 Keep me near Thee, blessed Jesus,
 Keep me near Thee lest I stray;  

[V1.2]
 With Thy mighty hand uphold me,
 Lead me gently all the way.  

[C1.1]
 Life without Thee would be dreary,
 Cheerless all my path would be;  

[C1.2]
 But while walking in Thy presence,
 Heaven’s glory shines on me.  

[V2.1]
 Keep me near Thee, precious Savior,
 Many snares are by the way;  

[V2.2]
 ’Neath Thy balmy wings protect me,
 Draw me nearer Thee each day.  

[V3.1]
 Help me live so near Thee, Jesus,
 That Thy whispers I may hear,  

[V3.2]
 Let me feel Thy arms around me
 When the hand of danger’s near.  

[V4.1]
 Draw me nearer, blessed Jesus,
 Closely fold me to Thy breast;  

[V4.2]
 Pillowed on Thy loving bosom,
 Let me ever sweetly rest.
