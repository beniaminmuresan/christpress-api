[V1.1]
 Wonderful, Merciful, Savior
 Precious Redeemer and Friend  

[V1.2]
 Who would have thought that a Lamb could
 Rescue the souls of man?  

[V1.3]
 Oh You’ve rescued the souls of man  

[V2.1]
 Counselor, Comforter, Keeper
 Spirit we long to embrace  

[V2.2]
 You offer hope when our hearts have
 Hopelessly lost our way  

[V2.3]
 Oh we’ve hopelessly lost the way  

[V3.1]
 You are the One that we praise
 You are the One that we adore  

[V3.2]
 You give the healing and grace
 Our hearts always hunger for  

[V3.3]
 Oh our hearts always hunger for  

[V4.1]
 Almighty, infinite, Father
 Faithfully loving Your own  

[V4.2]
 Here in our weakness you’ll find us
 Falling before Your throne  

[V4.3]
 Oh we’re falling before Your Throne
