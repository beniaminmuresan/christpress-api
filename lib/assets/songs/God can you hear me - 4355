[V1.1]
 I've been here before
 It's hard to ignore  

[V1.2]
 I'm so used to fighting
 The same old wars  

[V2.1]
 Oh what do you see when your looking at me
 Have I taken You for granted  

[V2.2]
 I can't afford this pain anymore
 Won't You help me understand it  

[B1.1]
 God can You hear me
 I need You here tonight  

[B1.2]
 I'm tired of pretending that everything's alright
 And I know, I know that You hold tomorrow  

[B1.3]
 But I need You here tonight  

[C1.1]
 I want to feel
 I need something real  

[C1.2]
 I want to go closer to You
 I lay down my will  

[V3.1]
 Oh this human disease it's killing me
 Tell me have I been left stranded  

[V3.2]
 I can't ignore this pain anymore
 Won't You help me understand it  

[T1.1]
 Say won't You say that
 You'll carry me  

[T1.2]
 Carry me through the storm
 Stay  

[T1.3]
 Won't You stay
 Till the morning comes  

[T1.4]
 Morning comes
 Just stay
