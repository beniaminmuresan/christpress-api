[V1.1]
 Dear Lord,
 I’m on my knees again  

[V1.2]
 I come to you because you understand.
 I’ve tried so hard, but I just can’t change myself  

[V1.3]
 That’s why I know I need your help.  

[C1.1]
 So here I am, this is my plea,
 My only hope is your love for me.  

[C1.2]
 I’m reaching out so desperately.
 Come take my hand, take all of me, just as I am.  

[V2.1]
 Oh Lord you made what’s broken new.
 Why can’t I learn, to follow you?  

[V2.2]
 I want to know you, to feel you
 In my soul, I surrender all control.  

[T1.1]
 I am not afraid to follow you where you lead me
 I can leave the past behind me.  

[T1.2]
 I’m forgiven, and I’m free
 My only hope is your love for me.  

[T1.3]
 I’m reaching out so desperately.
 Come take my hand, take all of me, just as I am
