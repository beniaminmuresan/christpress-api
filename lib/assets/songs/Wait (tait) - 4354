[V1.1]
 Looking out my front door
 I see a frantic world desperate for more  

[V1.2]
 Quick fix at your fingertips
 The longer it takes the harder it gets  

[C1.1]
 But I'll wait for You
 To give me everything I need  

[C1.2]
 I'm gonna wait for You
 You make my life complete  

[C1.3]
 Yeah, You know You do  

[V2.1]
 We want it all and we want it now
 Caught in a high speed chase, can't slow down  

[V2.2]
 Headed for a panic attack
 I gotta get off this one way track  

[C2.1]
 So I'll wait for You
 To give me everything I need  

[C2.2]
 I'm gonna wait for You
 You make my life complete  

[B1.1]
 I'm gonna wait wait wait for You
 Cause you're the perfect one for me  

[B1.2]
 I'm gonna wait wait wait for You
 Oh yeah  

[V3]
 I know You see the deepest part of me
 But still Your love for me is a mystery  

[B1.1]
 Wait for You to give me everything I need
 I'm gonna wait wait wait for You  

[B1.2]
 Ooh You make my life complete  

[T1.1]
 To give me everything I need
 I'm gonna wait wait wait for You  

[T1.2]
 God You make my life complete, yeah
 I'm gonna wait for You  

[T1.3]
 Oh yeah
