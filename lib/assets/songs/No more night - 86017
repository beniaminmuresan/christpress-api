[V1.1]
 The timeless theme, Earth and Heaven will pass away.
 It’s not a dream, God will make all things new that day.  

[V1.2]
 Gone is the curse from which I stumbled and fell.
 Evil is banished to eternal hell.  

[C1.1]
 No more night. No more pain.
 No more tears. Never crying again.  

[C1.2]
 And praises to the great "I AM."
 We will live in the light of the risen Lamb.  

[V2.1]
 See all around, now the nations bow down to sing.
 The only sound is the praises to Christ, our King.  

[V2.2]
 Slowly the names from the book are read.
 I know the King, so there’s no need to dread.  

[V3.1]
 See over there, there’s a mansion,
 Oh, that’s prepared just for me,  

[V3.2]
 Where I will live
 With my savior eternally.  

[T]
 All praises to the great "I AM."
 We’re gonna live in the light of the risen Lamb.
