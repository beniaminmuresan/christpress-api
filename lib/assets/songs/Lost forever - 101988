[V1.1]
 Where is thy hope, poor sinner?
 What are you going to do?  

[V1.2]
 Hope is a God-given anchor,
 Lavished so freely on you;  

[V1.3]
 If it is fixed in the Savior,
 On that bright shore you will land,  

[V1.4]
 But if in sin you still linger,
 Sad your end.  

[C]
 Lost, forever! Lost, forever!
 Oh, how sad!  

[V2.1]
 Where is thy refuge, sinner?
 Look where your pathway will end;  

[V2.2]
 Repent, or you’ll perish forever,
 Awful destruction’s at hand;  

[V2.3]
 Heaven or hell you are choosing,
 Fixing and sealing your fate,  

[V2.4]
 God and His mercy refusing,
 Lost! Too late!  

[V3.1]
 What can you plead, poor sinner,
 In the great judgment day?  

[V3.2]
 Heaven now offers you favor,
 Oh, do not cast it away;  

[V3.3]
 Slighted the warnings repeated,
 Leave you in Satan’s control;  

[V3.4]
 And with all heaven rejected,
 Lost, your soul.  

[V4.1]
 Where will you go, poor sinner?
 How will your soul escape?  

[V4.2]
 Think of thy lot, when, forever,
 Cast in the dark, burning lake;  

[V4.3]
 If then you’re lost and forgotten,
 Writhing in flames of despair,  

[V4.4]
 You will remember you’ve chosen
 To be there.
