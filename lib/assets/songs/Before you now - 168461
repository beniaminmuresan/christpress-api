[V1.1]
 Before you now,
 In the beauty of Your presence  

[V1.2]
 And as I bow
 You surround me with Your radiance  

[C]
 I worship you!
 I worship  you!  

[V2.1]
 Before you now
 As Your loving arms enfold me,  

[V2.2]
 I am in awe
 At the wonder of Your glory!  

[T]
 I've surrendered to Your call upon my heart!
 I am captured by your passion and desire!
