[V1.1]
 All these pieces broken and scattered
 In mercy gathered mended and whole,  

[V1.2]
 Empty handed but not forsaken,
 I've been set free, I've been set free !  

[C1.1]
 Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
 That saved a wretch like me.  

[C1.2]
 I once was lost, but now I am found,
 Was blind but now I see !  

[C1.3]
 Oh, I can see You now,
 Oh, I can see the love in Your eyes !  

[C1.4]
 Laying Yourself down, raising up the broken to life.  

[V2.1]
 You take our failure, You take our weakness,
 You set Your treasure in jars of clay.  

[V2.2]
 So take this heart, Lord, I'll be Your vessel
 The world to see Your life in me !
