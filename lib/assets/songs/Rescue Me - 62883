[V1.1]
 Deep is the river that I have to cross
 Heavy the weight on my shoulder  

[V1.2]
 I have discovered how great is the cost
 Of trying alone to cross over  

[V1.3]
 I try and I try but the current’s too strong
 It’s pulling me under and my strength is gone  

[V1.4]
 Don’t leave me stranded  

[C1.1]
 Rescue me, my God and my King,
 Water is rising and I cannot breathe,  

[C1.2]
 Wrap your arms all around me and
 Carry me over (rescue me) Carry me over  

[V2.1]
 There is a bridge that is easy to cross
 While all of our burdens are lifted  

[V2.2]
 Peace is the land that is waiting for us
 Lord, give me faith to believe it  

[V2.3]
 Cause I’m in a storm but I’m willing to fight
 I’ll overcome and I will not die with You by my side  

[T1.1]
 I will sail over the oceans and
 High over the mountains and  

[T1.2]
 Soar up to the Heavens
 Here is my hand is my heart and my soul and my mind
