[V1.1]
 I yield to Thee, Savior, forsaking my all,
 From sinful things now I will part;  

[V1.2]
 To Thee I surrender, for mercy I call,
 Come, take the first place in my heart.  

[C1.1]
 Oh, take the first place in my heart,
 Oh, take the first place in my heart;  

[C1.2]
 I open the door, come in, I implore;
 Lord, take the first place in my heart.  

[V2.1]
 Oh, come, gentle Spirit, donâ€™t leave me, I pray,
 From Thee I will never depart;  

[V2.2]
 I come to Thee now, for I cannot delay,
 Lord, take the first place in my heart.  

[V3.1]
 I cannot be lost, Lord, for Thee I will live,
 Forgiveness, O Savior, impart;  

[V3.2]
 If I will confess, Thou wilt freely forgive,
 And take the first place in my heart.  

[V4.1]
 The joybells of heaven will ring in my soul,
 My Savior, Redeemer, Thou art;  

[V4.2]
 To Thee I surrender, wilt Thou make me whole?
 Take now the first place in my heart.
